od.go

This is a simple calculator for determining the appropriate optical
density of laser protective eyewear based on a laser's beam diameter
and power output. It assumes the laser is a continuous wave diode
laser with an output in the visible spectrum (i.e. from the standard
445nm blue diode lasers to the 808nm red diode lasers). It is based
on the European EN207 standard for laser safety eyewear. This
standard is more strict than the U.S. ANSI Z 136 standard and
dictates an optical density that will withstand a 10s emission from
a CW laser. Users are strongly encouraged to familiarise themselves
with standard laser safety precautions, particularly when working
with class 3+ lasers. Please note that higher-power lasers are *not*
a toy, and proper safety precautions must be taken when operating
them.


USAGE
-----

od [-d beam diameter in mm] [-p beam power in W]

The defaults are a 9mm beam diamter (common in small lasers) and
1W output. This is much higher than consumer laser pointers (and
falls into the category of class 4 laser assuming a CW diode laser
in the visible spectrum).

Example:
	6mm beam diameter at 250mW:
	od -d 6 -p 0.25

	9mm beam diameter at 3W:
	od -p 3
